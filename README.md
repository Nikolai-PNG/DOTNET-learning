A compilation of a few mini projects ordered on run from latest to oldest!
Almost like a mini portfolio

So far I've only had some time over 2 days to mess with it, and that was a while ago...
last hour I fixed some bugs in Casino and moved it all over here!

I went through https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9THmGiSPjBQ&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oULFjxrOagaERVAMbmG20Xe this series.

I didn't get to do an OOP project yet, couldn't come up with what to do as I'm unfamiliar.
Will do that in mean time, whats the next step?

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
just run the Program.cs file, there I have a little console manager to test run.

note:
It has been 2 weeks since I did this, but fixing the bugs in Casino gave me refresh.
I did all of them without any tutorials, most would be googling something for lists like tuples, or some weird console input things. +occasional error
Casino was attempted with minimal googling and is the biggest mini project I did.
